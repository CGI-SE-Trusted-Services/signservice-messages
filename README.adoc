= Certservice-messages Project

This a project containing Java code to generate and parse various messages within other certservice projects.

It mainly consists of the following parts:


CS Message 2.0 (core message format) with a set of Payload Parsers (which also are generators).

** Credential Management Payload Parser
** Key Store Management Payload Parser
** System Configuration Payload Parser
** Assertion Payload Parser
** Authorization Payload Parser
** Encrypted CS Message Payload Parser

PKI Message generator (Older core message format) containing messages for credential management. 


Framework for generating and parsing Receipt Messages (but no actual message implementation exists in this project. See org.certificateservices.messages.receipts package for details. To implement a custom kind of receipt message used by certservice-ejbcacomponents or certservice-ejbcaproviders implement a custom RecieptParser, add the jar to the main applications classpath and use settings defined in certservice-ejbcacomponents or certservice-ejbcaproviders to specify your implementation.


Framework for generating and parsing Heartbeat Messages (but no actual message implementation exists in this project. See org.certificateservices.messages.heartbeat package for details. To implement a custom kind of receipt message used by certservice-ejbcacomponents or certservice-ejbcaproviders implement a custom HeartBeatParser, add the jar to the main applications classpath and use settings defined in certservice-ejbcacomponents or certservice-ejbcaproviders to specify your implementation.

== Updated Dependencies

In order to mitigate security vulnerabilties in XMLSEC 1.5.7 it has been upgraded to 2.2.3 which
updated a few dependencies to the build of this library:

 * slf4j-api-1.7.30.jar
 * xmlsec-2.2.3.jar

Other dependencies are:

 * bcprov-jdk15on-1.47.jar

== Message Specification Documentation

For detailed documentation of each available message and its content see directory src/site/resources.

== Using CS Message 2.0 Framework to generate or parse messages.

Before you start generating or parsing a CS Message 2.0 you need to initialize it once using a call to org.certificateservices.messages.csmessages.initCSMessageParser(MessageSecurityProvider securityProvider, Properties config). You can later retrieve the CSMessageParser using the getCSMessageParser() metod. As security provider you can either implement your own of use the org.certificateservices.messages.SimpleMessageSecurityProvider.

== Main Configuration Settings

By default is the DefaultCSMessageManager returned, but a custom implementation implementing CSMessageParser can be used as well

Settings for the configuration manager are:

|===
|Key |Description |Default value 

|csmessage.parser.impl |Implementation of CS Message Parser that should be used. |org.certificateservices.messages.csmessages.DefaultCSMessageParser 
|===

== DefaultCSMessageParser Settings

The default CS Message Parser have the following setting (pkimessage variants of the key is accepted for backward compability, see section for PKI Messages):

|===
|Key |Description |Default value 

|csmessage.sourceid |Source Id system sending messages, _(Required)_ |No Default 
|csmessage.sign |If generated messages should be signed. |true 
|csmessage.requiresignature |If parsed message has to have a valid signature. |true 
|csmessage.messagenamecatalogue.impl |If custom message name catalogue should be used. |See below 
|===

As default is Default Message Name Catalogue (setting the 'name' element in the message header), The default implementation takes the element name of the payload and sets it as message name. But specific organisations might have their own custom message names.

== SimpleMessageSecurityProvider Settings.

The simple message security provider uses a set of JKS as backend storage of its keys and have
the following settings.

|===
|Key |Description |Default value 

|simplesecurityprovider.signingkeystore.path

|RSA_OAEP_WITH_AES256

|simplesecurityprovider.trustkeystore.type
| The type of trust store used, can be either CA or ENDENTITY depending on trust policy used.
  If CA should the trust store contain the issuers (the entire chain) of a received signing certificate (from other parties) and
  if ENDENTITY it should contain the actual trusted signing certificates.

  If CA is used should settings: simplesecurityprovider.trustkeystore.matchdnfield and
  simplesecurityprovider.trustkeystore.matchdnvalue is recommended be set to authorize who can send messages. _(Optional)_

|===

=== Example Configuration using the truststore type CA

First make sure that you have a truststore JKS file that contains the complete chain of all CA certificates
that should be trusted. CS message only contains the end entity certificate.

Then define a policy for your application that all certificate that should be trusted should have for example OU=FRONTEND.

To configure this use the following trust store settings

[source, properties]
------
simplesecurityprovider.trustkeystore.type=CA
simplesecurityprovider.trustkeystore.path=<truststore jks path>
simplesecurityprovider.trustkeystore.password=<password>
simplesecurityprovider.trustkeystore.matchdnfield=OU
simplesecurityprovider.trustkeystore.matchdnvalue=FRONTEND
------

== Generating CS 2.0 Messages using payload parser.

After initializing the CS Message Parser it is possible to generate messages using a payload parser. Payload parser can be retrived from org.certificateservices.messages.csmessages.PayloadParserRegistry using the method getParser(String namespace). It is also possible to add your own implementations of a payload parser by using the register() method.

For examples on using the payload parser, especially on using it in combination with assertions. See work-flow examples in src/test/groovy/org/certificateservices/messages/csmessages/examples directory.

=== Available Payload Parsers.

The following build in pay load parser exists.

Credential Management Payload Parser, to generate credential management messages, See org.certificateservices.messages.credmanagement.CredManagementPayloadParser

Key Store Managment Payload Parser for generate key store management messages, see org.certificateservices.messages.keystoremgmt.KeystoreMgmtPayloadParser

System Configuration Payload Parser to generate system configuration messages, see org.certificateservices.messages.sysconfig.SysConfigPayloadParser

Assertion Payload Parser to generate assertions inserted into other payload messages, see org.certificateservices.messages.assertion.AssertionPayloadParser

Encrypted CS Message Payload Parser, not actually a payload but encrypts an entire CS Message into an Encrypted variant, see org.certificateservices.messages.encryptedcsmessage.EncryptedCSMessagePayloadParser

== Generating older PKI Messages

PKI Message was the first generation messages sent between clients and CA, mainly for requesting certificates.

To start generating or parsing messages create a PKI Message Parser using the org.certificateservices.messages.pkimessages.PKIMessageParserFactory
and instansiate a parser with the method genPKIMessageParser(MessageSecurityProvider securityProvider, Properties config). The MessageSecurityProvider
is the same as for CS Message Parser but doens't use any encryption functionality. 

== Main Configuration Settings

The following general setting exists for PKI Message Parsers:

|===
|Key |Description |Default value 

|pkimessage.parser.impl |Implementation of PKI Message Parser that should be used. |org.certificateservices.messages.pkimessages.DefaultPKIMessageParser 
|===

== DefaultCSMessageParser Settings

For the DefaultPKIMessageParser also exists the following settings:

|===
|Key |Description |Default value 

|pkimessage.sourceid |Source Id system sending messages, _(Required)_ |No Default 
|pkimessage.sign |If generated messages should be signed. |true 
|pkimessage.requiresignature |If parsed message has to have a valid signature. |true 
|pkimessage.messagenamecatalogue.impl |If custom message name catalogue should be used. |See below 
|===

== How to generate JAXB Class from XSD and Episode files

All XSD and episode files is in src/main/resources, episode files is to link existing classes from imported schemas such as xmldsig without
having to generate new classes. To generate use the following command (for multiple episode files use multible -b options)

[source]
----
xjc -d 'outputdir' 'xsd schema file' -p 'package name' -extension -b src/main/resources/'filename' -b src/main/resources/'filename' -disableXmlSecurity
----

For example:

[source]
----
xjc -d src/main/java src/main/resources/credmanagement_schema2_0.xsd -p org.certificateservices.messages.credmanagement.jaxb  -extension -b src/main/resources/csmessage-episode-jaxbbindings.xml -b src/main/resources/xmldsig-episode-jaxbbindings.xml -disableXmlSecurity
----

When generating jaxb code is usually not the correct xml prefixes set, this has to be configured manually in package-info.java class. Remember that when
regenerating the code using xjc is this information overwritten.

To save the result in a separate episode file for generation of dependencies add the parameter -episode 'filename'.

== Eclipse notes

Import the project with a eclipse supporting maven 2 and almost everything should be set-up
automatically, only add src/test/groovy as source folder and you should be ready to go.
